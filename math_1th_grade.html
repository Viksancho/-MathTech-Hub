            It seems like you're looking for a list of basic concepts typically covered by the end of the first grade. Here's a breakdown of what students typically learn:

1. **Numbers and Counting:**
   - Counting forward and backward from 1 to 120.
   - Recognizing and writing numbers up to 100.
   - Understanding the concept of tens and ones (place value).

2. **Addition and Subtraction:**
   - Adding and subtracting within 20, including solving word problems.
   - Understanding the relationship between addition and subtraction.

3. **Shapes and Geometry:**
   - Recognizing and naming basic shapes (e.g., square, circle, triangle, rectangle).
   - Describing and comparing shapes based on their attributes (e.g., number of sides, corners).
   - Understanding simple spatial relationships (e.g., above, below, beside).

4. **Measurement and Data:**
   - Using non-standard units (like cubes or paper clips) to measure length and height.
   - Collecting and organizing data using tally marks or simple graphs (e.g., bar graphs with pictures).

5. **Patterns:**
   - Recognizing, creating, and extending simple patterns with shapes, colors, and numbers.

6. **Time and Money:**
   - Telling time to the hour and half-hour on analog clocks.
   - Understanding basic concepts of money (e.g., identifying coins and their values).

7. **Basic Concepts in Algebra:**
   - Understanding and solving simple addition and subtraction equations (e.g., 5 + __ = 8).

8. **Problem-Solving:**
   - Using basic problem-solving strategies to solve mathematical problems orally and in writing.

9. **Mathematical Reasoning:**
   - Explaining mathematical thinking and reasoning verbally and through simple written explanations.

These concepts provide a foundational understanding of mathematics that prepares students for more complex topics in subsequent grades.
