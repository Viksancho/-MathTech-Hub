        <h1>Math 12th grade basic information</h1>
        <p>By the time students graduate from high school, they are anticipated to have developed a 
        comprehensive understanding of fundamental mathematical principles.
        This knowledge is acquired through their completed studies in courses such as Algebra II, Calculus, and Statistics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            From grasping the fundamental properties of functions and the ability to graph ellipses and hyperbolas from given equations
            to understanding the concepts of limits,
            continuity, and differentiation in Calculus assignments, students are expected to thoroughly 
            master these essential concepts to successfully 
            pursue their studies in college courses.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The following outlines the foundational concepts that should be achieved by the end of the school year,
            assuming that the mastery of concepts from the previous grade has already been attained.

        <h1>Algebra II Concepts</h1>
        <p>
            In the realm of studying Algebra, Algebra II represents the highest level that high school students are expected to complete, and they should understand all the core concepts of this subject by the time they graduate. Even though this class may not always be available depending on the school district's jurisdiction, its topics are also covered in precalculus and other math classes that students would take if Algebra II were not offered.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Students should comprehend the properties of functions, the algebra of functions, matrices, and systems of equations, as well as be able to classify functions as linear, quadratic, exponential, logarithmic, polynomial, or rational. Additionally, they should be proficient in identifying and working with radical expressions and exponents, as well as understanding the binomial theorem.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            A thorough understanding of advanced graphing is essential, encompassing the ability to graph ellipses and hyperbolas from specified equations, as well as systems of linear equations and inequalities, and quadratic functions and equations.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          This often involves incorporating probability and statistics, utilizing measures like standard deviation to analyze the dispersion of datasets from real-world scenarios, along with understanding permutations and combinations.
