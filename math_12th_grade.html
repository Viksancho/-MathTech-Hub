        <h1>Math 12th grade basic information</h1>
        <p>By the time students graduate from high school, they are anticipated to have developed a 
        comprehensive understanding of fundamental mathematical principles.
        This knowledge is acquired through their completed studies in courses such as Algebra II, Calculus, and Statistics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            From grasping the fundamental properties of functions and the ability to graph ellipses and hyperbolas from given equations
            to understanding the concepts of limits,
            continuity, and differentiation in Calculus assignments, students are expected to thoroughly 
            master these essential concepts to successfully 
            pursue their studies in college courses.
